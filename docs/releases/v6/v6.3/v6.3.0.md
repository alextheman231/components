<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/components` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add `Artwork` component, considered to be the artwork for this package's upcoming theme song, `An Interface For You And I`.
    - That song, along with the album it's part of, is expected to come to YouTube and streaming services soon, so keep an eye out for more announcements [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Alex-The-Man.231).

## Additional Notes

- It also comes with an end-to-end test that not only tests the package's entrypoints similarly to [how my utility package does it](https://github.com/alextheman231/utility/blob/main/tests/end-to-end/moduleResolution.test.ts), but it also exports the artwork as a PNG so it can then be used elsewhere.
- And yes, this means that this package can now have some sort of testing, finally!
- Previously this package barely had any tests as I didn't think it'd be worth testing all components as they're mainly UI elements.
- However now I am starting to see the value of end-to-end tests that verify the package can be consumed as intended (which is arguably the most important thing to want to be sure about, as nothing works if your entrypoints don't!)
